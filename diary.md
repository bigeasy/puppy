# Puppy

Notes:

 * Public keys are deployed using cloud config.
 * Export of keys can be done using a gpg so that transfer to a difference
 workstation is secure.
 * Let the user provide an alphabet if they like. Get rid of the number. Sort on
 the IP address. Delete everything with `cat alphabet | xargs puppy coreos down`.
