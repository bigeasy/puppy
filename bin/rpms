# This doesn't exist yet. Currently, I need to use emigrate to get the downloads
# into the development account. I don't have a way to propigate these
# dependencies. It could be as simple as copying them to the disk when I build
# the image, but it would be nice too, to have a repository I could rsync from
# to get these and install them.
